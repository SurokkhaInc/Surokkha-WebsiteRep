        <h1>Celebration of Surokkha Day</h1>
        July 23, 2023 <br>

    <p>On the one-year anniversary of the creation of the "Surokkha" poem, Shuvo and Bishan planned a grand celebration.
        They reminisced about the birth of the poem, the memes that followed, and the humor that filled their
        conversations for months to come. They planned to recreate some of the most iconic moments and even considered
        writing a sequel to the original poem. It was meant to be a day of laughter, nostalgia, and appreciation for
        their friend Kobi's unique creativity.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Kobi was unable to join the celebrations. Despite being the focal point of the festivities,
        circumstances prevented him from being a part of the day that was dedicated to his creation. Shuvo and Bishan
        felt his absence, but they decided to go ahead with the celebration, promising to fill Kobi in on all the
        details. The day was filled with laughter and reminiscing, but there was a palpable sense of incompleteness
        without Kobi's presence.</p>

    <h3>Poem written by Bishan to tribute Kobi</h3>
    <p>
        হে কবি, নীরব কেন..ইঁদুর এসেছে যে ধরায়,<br>

        সুরক্ষা কবিতাকে বরিয়া তুমি লবে না কি তব বন্দনায়?<br>

        কেন কবি এখনো এমন উন্মনা তুমি?<br>

        ওগো কবি, অভিমান করেছ কি??<br>

        যদিও আমি আর সৌমিক আসিয়াছি পালন করিতে পূর্তি তবু তুমি মোদের করিলে বৃথাই😢<br>

        গিয়াছে ইঁদুর চলিয়া ধীরে আম ময় খাটের তলে!!<br>

        আপনার লাফিয়ে লাফিেয় বিষ মেরে ইঁদুর মারার কথা ভুলিতে পারি না কোন মতে।<br>
    </p>
    <p>Just as the ceremony was drawing to a close, there was a surprise appearance that left everyone in astonishment.
        The special character from the poem, the metaphorical 'mouse', made an unexpected 'appearance'. This unexpected
        twist added a layer of humor and excitement to the end of the ceremony, leaving everyone with a memorable
        conclusion to the celebration.</p>
