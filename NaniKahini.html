        <h1>The Nani Kahini & The End of Early Surokkha Era</h1>

    <p>On another typical day, Shuvo posted a Surokkha Meme on the Zone group chat, but this time, it ignited a fury in
        Kobi like never before. However, Kobi, anticipating the continuous teasing, had already thought of ways to roast
        Shuvo in return. He unleashed his counterattack, but in the heat of the moment, Kobi's peculiar fantasy of being
        seduced by 80-year-old grandmothers was inadvertently laid bare for the whole group to see.</p>
    
    <p>In an unexpected turn of events, this peculiar strategy of "Roasting Yourself" was later incorporated into the curriculum of Business
        Majors at Harvard University. The incident was taught as an example of an unconventional strategy (Experts argue as an stupid and idiotic one) that, despite
        its initial shock value, managed to capture attention and spark discussions, thereby standing out amidst the
        usual noise.</p>
    <p>Facing a boycott in Bangladesh, Coca Cola decided to adopt a risky strategy similar to Kobi's "Roasting Yourself" strategy in their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/853nHw1KBbtcP5kq/">Ad Campaigns</a>. This
        unconventional approach, despite its risks, sparked public discussion.</p>

    <p>Following this event, the allure of Surokkha Memes and Surokkha Jokes began to wane among the Zone members. The once vibrant and humorous discussions around "Surokkha" that filled the group chat started to lose their appeal. This shift in attitude marked the end of what was known as the Early Surokkha Era.</p>
    <h3>Surokkha Quotes:</h3>
    <p>The only reason I still consider Kobi as one of my bros is because he khali nijerei dhoy na, he jare samne pay tarei dhuia dey (at least dhuia deoar try kore*)<br>-Shuvo</p>
