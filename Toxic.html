        <p>Fardin once found himself struggling with a particular math problem. As he grappled with the complex
            equations, he ended up creating a formula of his own. This formula, however, seemed to defy all conventional
            mathematical and physical principles. Intriguingly, it was so unique and perplexing that even the greatest
            minds in mathematics, such as Leonhard Euler and Karl Fredrich Gauss, were said to have risen from their
            graves in an attempt to decipher its meaning. Despite their unparalleled expertise and intellectual prowess,
            they too found themselves at a loss, unable to unravel the enigma of Fardin's formula.

            Labib, Bishan, and Shuvo engaged in playful banter with their friend Fardin. Overwhelmed by the teasing,
            Fardin voiced his feelings through an iconic quote: "Torar moto toxic manusher enemy o hoy na," a sentiment
            that has since resonated amongst his peers.

            Shuvo took this situation to another level by creating a meme about it, as Fardin's quote had hurt Bishan's
            feelings.
