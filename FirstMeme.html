        <h1>The First Surokkha Meme</h1>
        July 26, 2022 - Later that night <br>

                The visionary of “কবিতা মতান্তরে গদ্য” decided to share his work with his friends. Despite the
                masterpiece that "Surokkha" truly was, Phardin's friends did not show the appreciation it deserved. Their
                inability to grasp the profoundness and the unique blending of prose and poetry left Phardin's innovative
                work underappreciated within his close circle.

                <img src="Assets/1.jpg" width="300"> <br>
                <p>
                    Faced with the lack of appreciation and understanding from his friends, Phardin made the decision to
                    unsend his work from the group chat.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="Assets/2.jpg" width="300"> <br> <img src="Assets/3.jpg" width="300"> <br>
                <img src="Assets/4.jpg" width="300"> <br> <img src="Assets/5.jpg" width="300"> <br>
                <img src="Assets/6.jpg" width="300"> <br> <img src="Assets/8.jpg" width="300"> <br>
                <img src="Assets/7.jpg" width="300"> <br> <img src="Assets/9.jpg" width="300"> <br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Shuvo, one of Phardin's friends, saw an opportunity amidst the underappreciation of "Surokkha". Realizing
                the humor in the situation, he decided to create a meme out of the ongoing incident. This came to be
                known as the "Surokkha Meme", marking the beginning of a new trend that would soon take over their
                social circle and beyond.

            <p>
                Although the meme brought laughter to the group chat, Phardin did not share the same sentiment. The humor
                at his expense, stemming from his underappreciated passionate work, did not align with his feelings
                about the situation. Much like the woman in the video, Phardin's reaction was a mixture of surprise and
                disappointment.
