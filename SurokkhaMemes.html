        The members of the zone, never missing an opportunity, continued to tease and joke about Phardin, who later came
        to be known affectionately as "Kobi". Whether it was a casual conversation or a serious discussion, they would
        always find a way to bring up "Surokkha", turning it into a running joke within the group. This friendly banter,
        despite being at his expense, highlighted the camaraderie among the members and added a touch of humor to their
        interactions.
